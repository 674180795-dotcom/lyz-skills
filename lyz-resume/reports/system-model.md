# System Model

Skill: `lyz-resume`

- Stability score: `94/100`
- Stability band: `system-ready`
- Doctrine: Structure drives behavior: improve the boundary, feedback loops, drift watch, and leverage points before adding weight.

## System Boundary Map

- Owned job: 把杂乱候选人资料变成可信、岗位相关、排版完成、可直接投递的简历，并让低信息用户愿意轻松把真实经历说出来。
- Output boundary: 事实账本、岗位证据映射、可编辑同源 HTML、文本型 PDF、验证报告；多岗位时从同一事实源派生多个版本。
- Maturity assumption: `production`
- Input boundary:
  - 旧简历 PDF/DOCX/图片、零散文字、目标岗位或 JD、项目链接、口述回答、可选照片
- Non-goals:
  - 学术 CV、资深高管品牌叙事、作品集网站、求职信、面试训练、职业规划、职位代投。
- Constraints:
  - 保护隐私；不把推断当事实；用户可跳过/不知道/先出草稿；只有门禁通过才称为最终可投递。
- Standards:
  - 低负担访谈、事实可追溯、JD 关键词有证据、HTML/PDF 同源、页数与视觉验收通过。
- Human judgment boundary:
  - Ask one focused clarification when the real job, output, or exclusion boundary is unclear.
  - Escalate visible tradeoffs when benchmark patterns conflict with local privacy, naming, or governance constraints.
  - Do not silently broaden the skill into adjacent jobs just because the examples are nearby.

## Feedback Loops

### Intent boundary loop

- Signal: Intent confidence score is 73/100.
- Response: Ask only the highest-leverage clarification before adding package weight.
- Evidence: reports/intent-confidence.md and reports/intent-dialogue.md

### Reference synthesis loop

- Signal: Benchmark patterns are useful only after they are abstracted into borrow and avoid guidance.
- Response: Borrow one pattern at a time and keep the rest as reviewer-visible evidence.
- Evidence: reports/reference-synthesis.md
- Current patterns:
  - Borrow progressive disclosure: keep the entrypoint lean and move depth into references or scripts.
  - Borrow a small hypothesis-test-learn loop so the first revision is evidence-backed.
  - Borrow the habit of designing from the required hand-back output backwards.
  - Learn what quality, tone, workflow shape, or operating standard the user wants to preserve.
  - Do not let packaging or platform concerns swallow the core job boundary.

### Output quality loop

- Signal: Generated output may fail in recurring domain-specific ways.
- Response: Apply predicted output-risk families as self-repair checks before final output.
- Evidence: reports/output-risk-profile.md
- Current risk families:
  - Markdown readability
  - Screenshot and visual capture
  - Citation and footnote clutter
  - Tone and specificity
  - Tutorial quality

### Reviewer feedback loop

- Signal: Human review catches drift that static checks miss.
- Response: Capture lightweight feedback and turn repeated findings into gates or references.
- Evidence: reports/review-viewer.html and feedback records

### Lifecycle loop

- Signal: As reuse grows, the skill needs stronger gates, ownership, and regression evidence.
- Response: Promote only when the next gate improves reliability more than context cost.
- Evidence: manifest.json, reports/iteration-directions.md, and governance checks

## Delay And Drift Watch

### Trigger drift

- Watch signal: Users start invoking the skill for adjacent one-off or explanation-only requests.
- Countermeasure: Add near-neighbor exclusions and route evals before expanding workflow steps.
- Cadence: per trigger or description change

### Output drift

- Watch signal: Outputs remain valid but become generic, cluttered, or weakly aligned with the user's domain.
- Countermeasure: Refresh output-risk and artifact-design profiles, then add one self-repair check.
- Cadence: after the first 3-5 real uses
- Risk families:
  - Markdown readability
  - Screenshot and visual capture
  - Citation and footnote clutter
  - Tone and specificity
  - Tutorial quality

### Reference drift

- Watch signal: Borrowed benchmark patterns no longer fit the local job or add ceremony without payoff.
- Countermeasure: Re-run reference synthesis and keep only patterns that improve the current boundary.
- Cadence: per material benchmark or product assumption change

### Governance drift

- Watch signal: Skill usage becomes team-critical while ownership, review cadence, or rollback evidence stays informal.
- Countermeasure: Promote maturity tier and add reviewer-visible lifecycle evidence.
- Cadence: monthly

## Failure Pattern Map

### Boundary failure

- Symptom: The skill handles nearby requests that were never part of the recurring job.
- Repair: Narrow the description and add explicit non-goals before adding more execution steps.

### Feedback gap

- Symptom: The skill has rules but no signal telling authors which rule should change after use.
- Repair: Turn repeated reviewer feedback into one eval, one reference note, or one self-repair check.

### Output degradation

- Symptom: The result is structurally correct but generic, cluttered, or weakly matched to the user's domain.
- Repair: Use output-risk families as pre-final checks.
- Current Risk Families:
  - Markdown readability
  - Screenshot and visual capture
  - Citation and footnote clutter
  - Tone and specificity
  - Tutorial quality

### Prompt-behavior mismatch

- Symptom: The role, task, and format are copied from a prompt instead of becoming stable skill behavior.
- Repair: Convert reusable role/task/format assumptions into workflow, reports, or references.

## Highest Leverage Moves

### 1. Clarify the real job boundary

- Why: Intent uncertainty creates downstream trigger, output, and governance errors.
- Move: Ask one focused question and update intent context before adding assets.

### 2. Tune the frontmatter description

- Why: The description is the highest-leverage routing surface.
- Move: Name the recurring job, expected input, output, and strongest non-goal in compact language.

### 3. Install output self-repair checks

- Why: The likely failure families are: Markdown readability, Screenshot and visual capture, Citation and footnote clutter.
- Move: Add only the checks that prevent recurring output mistakes.

### 4. Borrow one pattern, not a whole product

- Why: External references improve quality when reduced to structure, not copied as surface style.
- Move: Start from: Borrow progressive disclosure: keep the entrypoint lean and move depth into references or scripts.

### 5. Close the lifecycle loop

- Why: Team-reused skills need visible ownership, review cadence, and regression evidence.
- Move: Keep manifest, review viewer, and iteration directions aligned after each material change.

## Reviewer Use

- Reviewer should ask whether the skill's structure will keep producing the desired behavior after repeated real use.
- Prefer changing the system boundary, feedback loop, or leverage point before adding more prose.
- If a problem repeats, convert it into a named failure pattern and one regression check.
